I write services as a backend engineer working on cloud/cloud supporting services and infrastructure. I have a strong background with devops and automation, particularly around infrastructure and deployment tooling. Most of my professional experience is in Python and Bash/shell, but have used Golang and Scala infrequently (though intensely), and have leveraged many more languages on a hobby level.

Interested in:

* Python
* Open source
* CyberSecurity
* Scripting/Automation/DevOps
* Building and working on tools and standards that empower developers to do work easier, faster, and cleaner.

Got any questions? Drop me an issue and I'll take a look!
